<!--Paragraph one-->
<article><p>Hello, my name is Kenyon Wilkerson, and I am a student at Boston University. I am currently pursuing a masters in
Software Development and hope that one day I can enter into the tech industry as a software engineer.
    I am currently living in the great state of Michigan where I was born and raised. I've attended private schools all my life,
first at Gesu for grade school, University of Detroit Jesuit for high school and Loyola University of Chicago for college.
    Some of my hobbies include coding, gaming, watching disney movies and sports. There are two in particular that I love to do more
    than the others and those are gaming (which I elaborate on in the Hobbies section) and sports, particularly watching the NFL. In fact, it's sort of a tradition in my family to go
    watch some football every Sunday.

</p></article>


    <!--Paragraph two-->
    <article><p>Like I mentioned earlier my family and I are football fans, and every Sunday we would go to
        Buffalo Wild Wings to watch the games and enjoy the food. Some of my fondest memories were when my family would come in to
        town during Christmas, and we would watch the games together. While most of my family moved away, I continue the traditions
        with the ones that are still in town. The main reason we would go watch the games is due to our uncle, Marvin Lewis being
        the head coach of the Bengals and while he is no longer a part of the team, some of my family members feel obligated to
        support the organization. As a Chiefs fan, we have friendly rivalries about whose team is going to win when they face
        off. Especially considering the Bengals kicked the Chiefs out of the playoffs last year! So when the Bengals made it
        to the Superbowl and lost on the final play of the game, it felt so good!
