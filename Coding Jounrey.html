<article id = "CodingJourneyText"><p>I got into coding at a young age of 16 after I stopped playing high school sports. I never really enjoyed playing
    , its just something that I got into when I was young and never stopped. However, after quitting I found myself with a
    lot of free time and decided to take up coding. Unfortunately, it was an onn and off relationship. I would learn how to
    code in Python for about 2 months, then stop for a while, just to try to pick it up again, rinse and repeat. This prevented
    me from actually truly learning how to code. This translated over to my college years, where instead of following my
    for coding, I went into biology to become a dentist. Fortunately, I had more time to think this through during the COVID-19 lockdowns
    and decided to fully commit to my passion by enrolling in this program.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I decided to pursue a career in coding is the fact that I love playing video games.
I owned almost every console and about 6 years ago, brought a PC for gaming. This PC allowed me to get into the coding
    aspect of gaming. After a while, I started to explore game development. I learned Unity and Unreal Engine, C# and C++,
    as these are the languages and frameworks most games are written in. While I have a long way to go, I am proud of
    the progress I made so far. Currently, I am in the very early stages of a Football game. I plan to include and learn
    more about collision detection, realistic movement and animation in Unity. Hopefully, in the near future, I have
    enough knowledge and skill to make my own game engine and no longer have to rely on Unity and Unreal.
