<p>Although I'm new to the tech industry and never worked an official job, I am very experienced
  in a plethora of languages. I feel as if my best language is Java due to using it so much for
  my classes. I have a couple of projects that I've completed and a couple that I'm working on currently.
  Below you will find some of those projects. Also below, there is a table that I created to show my confidence
  level in each programming language I know.</p>

  <h2>Programs I Was Apart Of</h2>
  <p>I was a part of two Apple programs regarding tech in the past year. The first one
    was GDYT's Code To Career, which was an association with the boys and girls club in my city. In this program we were tasked with
    created an application that serve the city of Detroit in some way. We were put in teams of 4 and were given
    resources on how to make an app. The main focus of the program was more on the theoretical
    side of application development (User Stories, deployment etc).My group created an idea called
    Talent Talk, which was a way for small, unrecognized talent in Detroit to get noticed. Essentially,the idea
    was that people can congregate in rooms that were either private or public. In each of these rooms,
    chosen people would get to perform for a set amount of time, while an audience watches. Think of it as an
    online version of "America's Got Talent". At the end of the program, each team would present their ideas on
    stage to an audience of people and my team's idea won. Below is a PDF to the presentation that we won with. The PowerPoint
    is interactable.</p>

  <p>The other program was similar to the GDYT one, however, this was more directly
    connected to Apple. It was Apple Developer Academy and in this program we were taught how to make more elaborate
    apps. This program focused more on coding in Swift than the theoretical side of things. Similairly, we were tasked with
    created an application that served the community and me and my team came up with a program called
    Fresh. This was an app idea that connects people to their community garden for the purpose of delivering
    fresh foods to underrepresented groups in Detroit. Below is the PowerPoint presentation</p>

  <p>I also created a resume that has all my work experiences, education and accolades.</p>
