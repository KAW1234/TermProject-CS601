    <article> <p >While I enjoy a lot of things, I have to say my main hobby is gaming. Ever since I was a child and was
    introduced to the N64 by my dad, playing video games has been my main hobby. Amongst my favorite games are 'Mario',
    'Sly Cooper', 'Crash Bandicoot' and many more. When my cousin would come into town, we'd stay up all night to playing
    Time Splitters on the PS2. There was also NickToons Unite, another game I remember my cousin and I playing all
    day in the early 2000s. While, as an adult I'm sometimes busy, I find try to find time to do my favorite hobby.
    In fact, around 2015 I purchased my first gaming computer. I assembled the parts myself and this could be seen as the
    beginning of my interest in technology. My system consist of a 1660 Super as a GPU, Ryzen 5 3600x as a CPU, 16g ram
    and a ASUS motherboard. Since I started coding, my computer as acted as a workplace for school and an entertainment
    setup, making it even more useful. </p>

        <p>I also just recently got a new gaming laptop as well. A Zephyrus Rog G15 and it's a beast of a machine.
            This thing can run almost any game as well as a desktop and what's best about it is that it's portable, so
            I can play games anywhere. The main advantage, however, is that gaming laptops are extremely powerful. Meaning
            that I can run any program like an IDE or graphic engine on the laptop. Which essentialy means I can work anywhere.
            This laptop was vital in the creation of this website even, as I had to travel a lot and, therefore, am away
            from my desktop. Most of this website was written on my laptop in fact. It's a very useful machine that allows me to
            game and work anywhere I go.
        </p>

        <p>Speaking of gaming,since it's almost the end of the year, I thought I'd go over my favorite games of the 2022. Below you will find
        a short list of games that I played in 2022 that I found enjoyable. I elaborate further in the blog section of my website. </p>
